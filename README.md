# **JS-Project**

##	* Project Overview
You are tasked with creating a HR application which contains employee information, you must capture the following data:  
•	Employee's NI Number  
•	Employee's Full Name  
•	Employee's Phone number  
•	Employee's Address  
•	Employee's Department   
Note: Please don't use anybody's real information - dummy information is perfectly fine  
The above information should be stored in an Array as JSON data. (There is no need for any DBMS - Database Management System)  

### * Project Requirements
You must meet the following requirements:  
•	The project must be written in PURE JavaScript  
•	All the employee information should be displayed on the screen  
•	Users must be able to add an employee to the list  
•	Users must be able to edit employee information  
•	Users must be able to delete an employee  
•	Users must be able to filter the list of employees based on their department through a dropdown box / search bar - i.e. HR, Sales etc.  
•	You must create separate files for your HTML, JS, CSS etc.  
Be as creative as you'd like with the design of the application.  


### * Why are we doing this project?
•	To use JavaScript functions for manipulation of the DOM.  
•	To use event listeners to link Javascript functions with HTML webpage.  
•	To explore functions that allow manipulation of arrays in particular a JSON object.  

### * How I expected the challenge to go
•	I expect to enjoy this challenge, and I did.  
•	I expected I would not know some of the functions, and would have to research them.  

### * What went well?
•	Fetch and Edit employees went well, as it was all covered in API on the course, and the functions only needed slight tweeking to fit purpose.  
•	Styling and HTML layout went as planned.  

### * What did not go as planned?
•	Update, and filter employees needed a bit of research - but documentation was available.  
•	Append child node did not work at all - had to use .innerHTML, which I know is a security risk.  

### * Possible improvements for the future
•	Responsive web design.  
•	Using .appendchildnode to add HTMl from JSON array - as if this website went live, would be a security risk.
